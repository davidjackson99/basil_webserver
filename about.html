            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>The intricate relationship between bioactive compounds and health outcomes necessitates a robust framework for scientific exploration and hypothesis generation. This project introduces a comprehensive database, BASIL (Bioactive Analysis for Systematic Insights and Longevity), designed to aggregate and analyze data on various bioactives derived from natural sources and their associated health effects. </p>
            <p>Utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques, we have systematically reviewed and extracted data from a multitude of sources, including PubMed clinical trials, FooDB, Phenol-Explorer, and ChEMBL. The database not only catalogues bioactive substances and their health impacts but also contextualizes the strength of evidence supporting each association. Through the employment of various data visualization techniques such as network graphs and heatmaps, we provide an accessible platform for researchers to discern patterns and research trends. </p>
            <p>Our analysis reveals significant insights into the most potent bioactives, identifies research gaps, and supports the scientific community in developing targeted nutritional interventions and therapies. This paper discusses the methodologies employed in data collection, the challenges of data heterogeneity, and the potential implications of our findings in the broader context of nutritional science and therapeutic development.</p>

            <h1>Disclaimers</h1>
            <p>Please note that the data included in the BASIL database is for educational and research use only. Great care has been taken in preparing the information, but the nature of scientific data is such that revisions and updates are continually needed. The BASIL team includes data scientists, not medical or health professionals. We are committed to continuous development of the database and making efforts to enhance the quality and accuracy of the information on a step-by-step basis.</p>
